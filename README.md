# 🐶 Doggy GPT (using FastAPI🚀)

This is an implementation of a chatbot using OpenAI API, called Doggy GPT. 

Obviously, this project is linked with the [DoggyGPT-frontend 🪄](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/doggy-gpt-frontend) repository.

This project was created for educational purposes and uses FastAPI🚀, Pydantic🔼, Python🐍, and MongoDB🍃.

During this project, I learned and practiced:

* FastAPI 🚀 (the main purpose of the project was to keep learning this framework)
* MongoDB 🍃 (using PyMongo)
* OpenAI API 🤖 (how to use the API and how to use the models)
